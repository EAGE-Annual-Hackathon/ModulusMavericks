# Norne Net-Zero Forecasting Project

## Project Summary

### Objective
The objective of this project is to leverage NVIDIA Modulus, a physics-informed neural network framework, to forecast and achieve net-zero emissions for the Norne gas field in Norway. Our team, the **Norne Net-Zero Navigators**, aims to develop an innovative and efficient solution to predict and mitigate the environmental impact of gas field operations, aligning with global sustainability goals. This project is part of the EAGE 2024 Hackathon, held in Oslo, Norway, from June 9-10, 2024.

### Background
The Norne gas field, located on the Norwegian continental shelf, is a significant source of natural gas. However, its operations contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, necessitating robust forecasting and mitigation strategies to achieve net-zero emissions. NVIDIA Modulus provides an advanced platform to model complex physical systems and predict outcomes with high accuracy.

### Project Goals
1. **Data Collection and Analysis**: Gather historical and real-time data related to gas production, emissions, and environmental factors.
2. **Model Development**: Utilize NVIDIA Modulus to create a detailed model of the Norne gas field, incorporating physics-informed neural networks to simulate various operational scenarios.
3. **Emission Forecasting**: Predict future emissions under different operational conditions and identify potential pathways to achieve net-zero emissions.
4. **Optimization Strategies**: Develop and propose actionable strategies to reduce emissions, optimize energy use, and enhance the sustainability of gas field operations.
5. **Visualization and Reporting**: Create interactive dashboards and comprehensive reports to visualize forecasting results and recommend best practices for stakeholders.

### Methodology
1. **Data Integration**: Compile and preprocess data from multiple sources, including satellite imagery, sensor networks, and historical records.
2. **Model Training**: Train the neural network model using NVIDIA Modulus, validating its accuracy through cross-validation and real-world data comparison.
3. **Scenario Analysis**: Simulate various operational scenarios to understand their impact on emissions and identify optimal paths to net-zero.
4. **Strategy Formulation**: Collaborate with experts to develop feasible strategies based on model predictions, focusing on renewable energy integration, efficiency improvements, and carbon capture technologies.
5. **Implementation and Monitoring**: Implement recommended strategies and establish a monitoring framework to track progress and make necessary adjustments.

### Expected Outcomes
- A robust forecasting model for emissions at the Norne gas field.
- Clear, actionable strategies to achieve net-zero emissions.
- Enhanced understanding of the interplay between gas field operations and environmental impact.
- Tools and frameworks that can be adapted for other gas fields and industrial sites aiming for sustainability.
