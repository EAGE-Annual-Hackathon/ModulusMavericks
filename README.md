# Norne Net-Zero Forecasting Project

## Project Summary

### Objective
The objective of this project is to leverage NVIDIA Modulus, a physics-informed neural network framework, to forecast and achieve net-zero emissions for the Norne gas field in Norway. Our team, the **ModulusMavericks**, aims to develop an innovative and efficient solution to predict and mitigate the environmental impact of gas field operations, aligning with global sustainability goals. This project is part of the EAGE 2024 Hackathon, held in Oslo, Norway, from June 9-10, 2024.

### Background
The Norne gas field, located on the Norwegian continental shelf, is a significant source of natural gas. However, its operations contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, necessitating robust forecasting and mitigation strategies to achieve net-zero emissions. NVIDIA Modulus provides an advanced platform to model complex physical systems and predict outcomes with high accuracy.

### Team
We are the **ModulusMavericks**, a dedicated team of geoscientists with a string background in data scientists passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technology to create a sustainable future. 

Our team members include:
- **Roderick Perez** (OMV)
- **Jorge Nustes** (Viridien)
